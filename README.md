The file containing the function is **basic functions.hs**. In order to use it, you need to write:

`import BasicFunctions` if you are writing your code in a file

`:l BasicFunctions` if you are using the terminal

Functions contained:
1. fac (calculating the factorial of a number)
2. replicate' (creating a list that contains a number n times)
3. take' (Creating a list that contains all the elements greater than the one chosen)
4. reverse' (Reversing a list)
5. repeat' (Creates a list that contains a number infinite times)
6. zip' (zipping 2 lists togrether. Creating one list that the first argument is the first list and the second argument is the second list)
7. elem (Checks if an element exists in a list)
8. quicksort (The fastest algorithm to sort a list)
